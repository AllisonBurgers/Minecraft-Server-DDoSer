## History
666 years ago, Lusin played on a Minecraft server named ShockNetwork hosted by a friend named FlamingPaw.  There was many good times, and Lusin dominated the server with epic skills and awesome hacks.

Everyone loved Lusin on ShockNetwork.  They worshiped Lusin like a king.

Lusin once defeated 100 players in a legendary PVP on ShockNetwork, and afterwards, Lusin apologized.

...

**TO ABSOLUTELY NOBODY!**

Because the King does whatever the fuck he wants.
