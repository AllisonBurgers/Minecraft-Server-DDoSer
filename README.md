## History
666 years ago, Lusin played on a Minecraft server named ShockNetwork hosted by a friend named FlamingPaw.  There were many good times, and Lusin dominated the server with epic skills and awesome hacks.

Until one day, FlamingPaw said Spongebob was a better anime than My Little Pony.

The Minecraft Server DDoS'er destroyed FlamingPaw's Server.  Within a single day, FlamingPaw apologized and accepted that Lusin was right:  My Little Pony is the greatest anime of all-time.
