## History
### The Early Days
666 years ago, Lusin played on a Minecraft server named ShockNetwork hosted by a friend named FlamingPaw.  There was many good times, and Lusin dominated the server with epic skills and awesome hacks.

Until one day, FlamingPaw told Lusin Spongebob was a superior anime than My Little Pony.

**HOW DARE FLAMINGPAW CHOOSE SPONGEBOB OVER MY LITTLE PONY!**

### Minecraft Server DDoS'er Development
Lusin got to work developing the Minecraft Server DDoS'er.  Lusin is the greatest programmer who has ever lived, and within a month, created the Minecraft Server DDoS'er!

### Lesson Learned
The Minecraft Server DDoS'er was used on FlamingPaw's Server.  Within a single day, FlamingPaw apologized and accepted that Lusin was right:  My Little Pony is the greatest anime of all-time.
